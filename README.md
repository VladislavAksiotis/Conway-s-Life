# Conway-s-Life
One of the many implementations of Conway's Game of Life.

To start the game you should run all the cells in front of "Game and shapes" header and call game() function with your coordinates inside. Several well-known structured shapes have already been implemented. It's also possible to generate Gaussian-distributed coordinates to find a new beautiful pattern.
