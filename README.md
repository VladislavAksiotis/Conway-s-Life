# Conway-s-Life
One of the many implementations of Conway's Game of Life.

To start the game you should open "Infinite Life.ipynb" file, then run all the cells in front of "Game and shapes" header and call game() function with your coordinates inside. Several well-known structured shapes have already been implemented. It's also possible to generate Gaussian-distributed coordinates to find a new beautiful pattern.

Without the code you could see an example of the glider in "Life_of_glider.mp4".
